## 📊 Key Analyses

- 📅 Time Series Analysis (confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries)
- 🌎 Country-wise comparisons (India, US, Italy, etc.)
- 🧮 Case Fatality Rate (CFR) and Recovery Rate trends
- 🔍 Daily vs cumulative case plots
- 💡 Interactive dashboards (Power BI & Excel)

---

## 🔍 Insights

- India saw a rapid increase in cases post-May 2020
- Countries with high CFR: Italy, UK during early months
- Recovery rates improved over time globally
- Vaccination (optional extended version) reduced daily cases in 2021
